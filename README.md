# 20487-DevelopingWindowsAzureAndWebServices
In this course, students will learn how to design and develop services that access local and remote data from various data sources. Students will also learn how to develop and deploy services to hybrid environments, including on-premises servers and Windows Azure. This course helps people prepare for exam 70-487.

## What are we doing?
To support course 20487C Developing Windows Azure and Web Services, we will need to make frequent updates to the course content to keep it current with the Azure services used in the course. We are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub to allow for open contributions between the course authors and MCTs to keep the content current with changes in the Azure platform.

The initial release of lab files contains solutions built on ASP.NET 5 beta 8 and RC0.

We hope that this brings a sense of collaboration to the labs like we've never had before - when Azure changes and you find it first during a live delivery, go ahead and make an enhancement right in the lab source. Help your fellow MCTs.

## Where will the files be?
The files are available in a GitHub repo at https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20487-DevelopingWindowsAzureAndWebServices

##How should I use these files relative to the released MOC files?
- These open files are designed to be used by MCTs to prepare for the upcoming release of the 20487C. They are in GitHub as a central repository so MCTs and course authors can have a shared source for the latest files.
- It will be recommended that for every delivery of 20487C, trainers check GitHub for any changes that may have been made to support the latest Azure services, and get the latest files for their delivery.

##How do I contribute?
- Any MCTs can submit a pull request to the code or content in the GitHub repro, Microsoft and the course author will triage and include changes as needed.  
- You can submit bugs, changes, improvements, ideas.  Find a new Azure feature before we have?  Submit a new demo!

##What about changes to the student handbook?
The student handbook will be released in calendar year 2016 and will be updated on a regular basis through normal MOC release channels as needed.
